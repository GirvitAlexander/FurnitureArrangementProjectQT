The position of the door and windows in the room, as well as the specified default parameters, must be set in an external file. There is the following list of furniture: a table, a chair, an armchair, a sofa, a wardrobe (their dimensions are parameters according to the projection from above and are determined by the user interactively). It is required by choosing pieces of furniture sequentially, arrange them in a room in an acceptable way. They can be rearranged.
